### Brief Report

The repository is composed of two parts:

Folders for every package, which contain samples, documentation and so on, to get a quick idea of these libs.

Folders named after date are my practice, which means I imitated typeset but has nothing to do with the content.

This repo is also used for my daily learning blog, with NIPS paper format.
