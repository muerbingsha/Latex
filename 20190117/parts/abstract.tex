We introduce a new language representation model called \textbf {BERT}, which stands for \textbf {B}idirectional \textbf {E}ncoder \textbf {R}epresentations from \textbf {T}ransformers. Unlike recent language representation models \citep{Matthew2018, Alec2018}, BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT representations can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, \emph {without} substantial task-specific architecture modifications. 

BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE benchmark to \textbf{80.4\%} (\textbf{7.6\%} absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to \textbf{86.6\%} (\textbf{5.6\%} absolute improvement) and the SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test  F1 to \textbf{93.2\%} (\textbf{1.5} absolute improvement), outperforming human performance by \textbf{2.0}.
